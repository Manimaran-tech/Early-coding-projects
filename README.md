<h1> My School Projects
This repository contains a collection of my early projects that sparked my interest in coding and helped me grow as a developer. Each project has played a significant role in shaping my understanding of programming, problem-solving, and project management.

1. Fruit Shop (My First Project)
The Fruit Shop project was my very first step into the world of coding. The idea was simple—a console-based application where users could browse and purchase fruits from a virtual store. It introduced me to the basics of programming, including:

User input/output: Understanding how to interact with users.
Basic logic building: Implementing simple conditions like availability checks, pricing, and billing.
Loops and control structures: To keep the shop running and handle multiple customers.
This project made me realize how fun and powerful coding can be. Even though it was simple, the joy of creating something functional made me fall in love with programming.

2. Hand Cricket Game (Bringing Real-Life Fun to the Virtual World)
The Hand Cricket Game was my second project, where I took the idea of a real-world game that I often played with friends and replicated it digitally. The goal was to create an interactive game between the user and the computer.

What I learned:

Random number generation: To simulate the computer's moves.
Game logic: Writing algorithms to follow the rules of hand cricket, like scoring runs and getting out.
Real-time interaction: Ensuring the game was responsive and fun.
This project gave me the idea that anything in the real world can be brought to life through code. It was a big step in my journey to think about how virtual applications can replicate real-world experiences.

3. TNEA Counseling System (Understanding Project Complexity and Maintenance)
The TNEA Counseling System was my final school project and one of the most complex ones I worked on. This project aimed to replicate the Tamil Nadu Engineering Admissions (TNEA) counseling process, where students are allocated colleges based on their scores and preferences.

To manage student and college data, I used SQL for efficient data storage and retrieval. This allowed the system to handle large datasets and perform key operations like sorting, filtering, and searching through the database.

What this project taught me:

SQL database management: Designing a database schema and using SQL to store and query data efficiently.
Data handling: Managing large sets of data, such as student scores and college availability.
Algorithm design: Implementing logic to match students with colleges according to their preferences and ranks, similar to real-world counseling processes.
User interaction: Designing an intuitive interface where students could input their preferences and view the results.
Project planning and maintenance: I learned how important it is to plan a project from the ground up, think about scalability, and write maintainable code that could be easily updated for future changes.
This project gave me a solid foundation in understanding how real-world systems are built and maintained. It also taught me the importance of debugging, refining code, and managing complex workflows.

Conclusion
These projects represent my growth as a coder, from starting with simple applications to building more complex systems. I’m continuously learning, and these projects have been key milestones in that journey. Each one has added to my skill set and given me new perspectives on how to approach problems and solutions in the digital world.

I’m excited to keep building, learning, and growing as a developer!
